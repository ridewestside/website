## Who We Are

Ride Westside is a community cycling group based in Washington County, Oregon. We bring together cyclists of all skill levels who live, work, or ride in the western Portland metro area.

## What We're About

We believe that bikes build community. Our mission is to:

- **Connect cyclists** in Washington County who might otherwise feel isolated from Portland's bike culture
- **Advocate for better infrastructure** so everyone can ride safely
- **Host fun, inclusive rides** that welcome beginners and experienced cyclists alike
- **Build relationships** between riders, local businesses, and community leaders

## Join Us

Whether you're a daily commuter, weekend warrior, or just bike-curious, you're welcome to join any of our rides. No membership required, no fees, just show up and ride!
